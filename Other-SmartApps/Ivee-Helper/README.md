Allows you to control a group switches by changing the status of a master switch.

Works great when used with Ivee, voice controlled clock.

It is recommended to use a simulated switch as the master switch. You will need to ensure it is toggled on or off depending on whether you want to control the change in status via Ivee. In my case, I simply turn the simulated switch on in the morning routines, and only use Ivee to turn off all the lights in the house in the evening. This program and its usage have room for improvement.
